# Physiobank

Not sure what this folder should be called, or what it will encompass. Likely part of Amit project to make a physiological signal database. First will start by organizing ECG data at minimum.

# File Organization

## What type of files are within the folder?

There are multiple folders in the original Amit Research Drive, named _Ischemic and Genetic Mechanisms_.

- Datasets for analysis = MIMS and MIPS data
- Digitized ECG = Twins and Biobank and MIMS and MIPS ECG data / images
- HRV = empty folder
- MIMS2 research export = huge folder of HEA, SIG, and QRS file extensions, unclear which patient population
- Outcomes = MIMS and MIPS SAS data
- VU AMS data = appears to be range of data sets, powerpoints, etc on VUDAMS data

## Approach to explore the file trees
